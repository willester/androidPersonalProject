# androidPersonalProject

This project was made after the first semester of my 3rd year of university. Because of my interest in the Android development course from my university, I've decided
to improve my Android skills by building this app.
The app is basically an app for managing the items from an auction house, the idea was given to me by a friend that was pretty annoyed by the bidding function of ebay.

-- FUNCTIONABILITY--

There are 2 types of accounts: buyers and seller. Each of the users can see reports regarding their type of account: for sellers they can see the profit they made and 
details about the buyers and items and for buyers they can see reports about their favorite items and what they acquired until that moment.

The UI of the app is quite  user friendly and in order to give buyers an idea how an item would look, a picture from an URL that is based on a category that
the item belongs to will be displayed. 
The app is persistant using a SQLite database behind it so each change(regarding items like buying) will be updated to each user and be displayed accordingly.
There was also a Google Maps API implemented that shows on the maps the location of the items.

For testing purposes, when the app loads for the first time some dummy accounts for seller and buyers will be created and also some items.
This is not an app designed to be launched on the market but with some improvements in the fututre it may be.
The project was made in 1-2 months due to technical problems and Android Studio being too demading.

If you want to test the app it can be done  using the emulator inside Android Studio or a normal phone that has developer mode activated.
